##UIAlertView+Activity

A category added to UIAlertView class, that displays an UIActivityIndicator in an alert view, with optional cancel button. Current implementation probably wouldn't work well in cases, where your object needs to be the delegate of the UIAlertView. Any patches with this or other additional functionality are welcome! :)
